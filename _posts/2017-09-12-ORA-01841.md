Question: I have a table with a column having date as 20150324 i.e YYYYMMDD.
When I try to load this data via sqlldr , it gives me the ORA-01841 error
 
ORA : 01841.
ORA-01841: (full) year must be between -4713 and +9999, and not be 0 
My SQL*Loader control file looks like this:
```
admidate date 'YYYYMMDD' NULL IF admidate = BLANKS;
 ```
Answer: The oerr utility notes this on the ora-01841 error:
 
ORA-01841: (full) year must be between -4713 and +9999, and not be 0

Are you trying to load NULL values in records?

If so, can you do a "change all" to make the NULL values NOT NULL

There is lots of good advice on this error on Google.

Can you view the records to load and visually inspect the date formats?

Try this date format:
```
admidate     date "YYYYMMDD"    nullif (admidate=BLANKS)
```

If you are loading a column with a DATE datatype, then you need to use the to_date function:
```
admidate TO_DATE("admidate",'yyyymmdd') nullif (admidate=BLANKS)
```
