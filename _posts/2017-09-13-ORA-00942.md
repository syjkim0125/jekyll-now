---


if you faces this error, check this 4 cases.

1. Database not connected.
2. Table not authorized.
3. Spelling error or indeed table does not exist.
4. Naming the owner in front of the table and SELECT.



Ex1) 
```
- Reconnect to the database.
```

Ex2) 
```
- Ask your DBA for permission.
```

Ex3) 
```
- SELECT * FROM TABEL;
-> SELECT * FROM TABLE;
```

Ex4) 
```
- SELECT * FROM owner.TABLE
```
