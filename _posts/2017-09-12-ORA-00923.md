If you faces this error, Check out follow things.



1. Checks the SELECT portion of COLUMN between SELECT and FROM.


Ex)
```
GENDER AS g,
LAST_VISIT_DT AS l,
FROM table_name
```
-> you must delete ',' where in front of FROM
```
GENDER AS g,
LAST_VISIT_DT AS l
FROM table_name
```

2. Check the alias.

```
Ex1) where you put the '', delete or change that.
```
```
Ex2) as the game -> never put the space.
```
-> as tg


3. Syntax check. 

```
Ex) The part that fetches the upper data. 
```

[MSSQL]
```
SELECT TOP 10*
```
--> Change 

[ORACLE]
```
WHERE ROWNUM <= 10
```
